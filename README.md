University of Michigan - Applied Plotting, Charting &amp; Data Representation in Python

## 🧸💬 How do I program an automatic environmental conditions learning machine?
🐨🎁🎵🎶 Possible create response action(s) at the time events settings, synchronize, learning, and transferable optimize for learning and setup task operation. </br>
🐑💬 ➰ From running the application add some variables for learning or optimizing solutions for the problem such as wind velocity, gravity, friction, and momentum that create of more fun way of research study. </br>
🦭💬 Dragging force and temperature when working underwater with a slow stream  🦭🦭💬 Smell does not count. </br>
🦭💬 I have watched many times of television programs about the winner of AI snake robots and fish robots for underwater captivated area rescued robots, the winner is a high school student and this inspires him to build many AI machine learning examples for study and they are not too difficult for kids as it is a cartoons. </br>

## 🧸💬 What are single-degree and double-degree changes in statistics and an example of an application for machine learning?
🧸💬 A double degree is velocity differentiated from the first degree when the first degree explains slope or velocity the second degree is acceleration or the integration area. </br>
🐑💬 ➰ Possible to create the same work by a similar pattern, it is not directly differentiated or ratios but it is continuity of change and velocity of the values as streams. </br>
🐐💬 Similar to circuit current it needs to follow the sequence patterns and be synchronized. Do you see Ben's YouTube he plotted an oscilloscope graph with harmonic frequency response, high contrast with different sources is not always synchronized and this is the basic method to verify the same source's current or working of intelligences. </br>
🐨🎁🎵🎶 It is similar to a high-school student's experiment with the harmonics frequency forks to response scopes of frequency in ranges as they are from the same sources, diodes circuits, and some computers are working on this basis. </br>
